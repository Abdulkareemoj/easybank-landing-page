## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- Javascript

### What I learned

I leaned how to make develop responsive site for multiple devices using plain HTML and CSS with SASS. It was definitely tougher but i learnt a lot with this project especially for styling.
I think i'll use SASS going forward for front-end projects now. it definitely helps to separate sections of the code styling to fix errors fast.
